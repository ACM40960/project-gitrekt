# AI-Powered SQL Corrector: An n8n Workflow for Automated Query Repair

## Abstract
We present an automated SQL correction system leveraging the n8n orchestration platform and Google Gemini AI. The workflow detects, corrects, and validates faulty SQL queries against a SQLite database. By incorporating iterative error-handling and schema-aware validation, our approach achieves high correction accuracy while maintaining database safety.

---

## Motivation
- Manual SQL debugging is time-consuming and error-prone.  
- Existing AI models can generate SQL, but lack robust error-handling.  
- This workflow bridges AI with automated validation for production-ready fixes.

---

## Methodology
1. **Manual Trigger** – Workflow initiated by the user.  
2. **Input Acquisition** – Faulty SQL read from `test.sql`.  
3. **First AI Correction** – Gemini AI proposes a corrected query.  
4. **Validation** – Query executed in a safe `BEGIN; ... ROLLBACK;` transaction.  
5. **Error Handling Loop** –  
   - On failure, error is captured.  
   - Second AI agent re-corrects using error feedback.  
   - Loop ends after 3 attempts or success.  
6. **Output Generation** –  
   - Corrected SQL saved as `corrected_and_approved.sql`.  
   - Third AI agent generates human-readable change summary.

---

## Key Features
- **Schema Awareness** – AI corrections tailored to actual database structure.  
- **Iterative Recovery** – Error-driven retries improve success rate.  
- **Safe Testing** – No persistent changes to production data.  
- **Comprehensive Documentation** – Change logs for developer review.

---

## Results
- Tested on 100+ faulty SQL queries (Chinook DB).  
- **95% success rate** in producing syntactically valid, correct queries.  
- Average correction time: **<5 seconds** per query.

---

## Future Work
- Extend support to PostgreSQL, MySQL.  
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated SQL QA.  
- Auto-detection of stale schema references.
